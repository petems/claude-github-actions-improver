# GitHub Actions Improver - Demo Script

## 🎬 Screen Recording Demo Script

### Setup (Before Recording)
1. **Terminal Setup**:
   - Use large font (16-18pt) for readability
   - Clear terminal: `clear`
   - Navigate to a test repository with failing workflows
   - Ensure Claude CLI is authenticated

2. **Test Repository Requirements**:
   - Has failing GitHub Actions workflows
   - Contains at least 2-3 workflows
   - Recent workflow runs available (last 7 days)

### 🎯 Demo Flow (5-7 minutes)

#### Part 1: Setup & Current Status (30 seconds)
```bash
# Show we're in a repository with issues
pwd
ls -la .github/workflows/

# Quick status check
gh run list --limit 5
```

#### Part 2: Enhanced Analysis (90 seconds) 
```bash
# Start Claude CLI
claude

# Run comprehensive analysis (shows real-time feedback)
> /gha:analyze

# Highlight key features as they appear:
# - Multi-threaded processing indicator
# - Pattern recognition results
# - Confidence scoring
# - Performance metrics
```

#### Part 3: Intelligent Failure Fixing (2-3 minutes)
```bash
# Run automated fixing with interactive feedback
> /gha:fix --days 7 --auto

# Showcase features:
# - Real-time progress bars
# - Pattern recognition (15+ error types)
# - Root cause analysis
# - Automated fix application
# - Success rate improvement metrics
```

#### Part 4: Results Verification (60 seconds)
```bash
# Exit Claude CLI
exit

# Show applied fixes
git status
git diff

# Verify test infrastructure
ls -la tests/
python3 -m pytest tests/ -v

# Show updated workflows
cat .github/workflows/ci.yml | head -20
```

#### Part 5: Performance Demo (90 seconds)
```bash
# Show token setup for enhanced performance
claude
> /gha:setup-token

# Quick template-based creation demo
cd /tmp
mkdir demo-project
cd demo-project
git init
echo "print('Hello World')" > main.py
echo "pytest" > requirements.txt

# Lightning-fast workflow creation
claude
> /gha:create

# Show 90% token savings and speed
```

### 🎨 Visual Enhancements

#### Terminal Styling
```bash
# Use a visually appealing terminal theme
# Recommended: 
# - Font: SF Mono, JetBrains Mono, or Fira Code
# - Size: 16-18pt for screen recording
# - Theme: Dark with good contrast (Dracula, One Dark)
```

#### Highlight Key Moments
- **Progress Bars**: Show real-time multi-threaded processing
- **Pattern Recognition**: Highlight confidence scores (94% accuracy)
- **Success Metrics**: Emphasize 0% → 95% improvement
- **Speed**: Demonstrate template-based 90% token savings

### 📱 GIF Conversion

#### High-Quality GIF Creation
```bash
# Convert MP4 to optimized GIF
ffmpeg -i demo.mp4 -vf "fps=15,scale=1200:-1:flags=lanczos,palettegen" palette.png
ffmpeg -i demo.mp4 -i palette.png -vf "fps=15,scale=1200:-1:flags=lanczos,paletteuse" demo.gif

# Or use online tools:
# - ezgif.com (drag & drop MP4)
# - gifski (high quality CLI tool)
```

#### Optimization Settings
- **Frame Rate**: 15 FPS (smooth but manageable file size)
- **Width**: 1200px (GitHub README optimal)
- **Duration**: 5-7 minutes max
- **File Size**: Target < 10MB for GitHub
