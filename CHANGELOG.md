## Migration Guide

### From v1.x to v2.1.0

1. **Update Installation**:
   ```bash
   git pull origin master
   ./install-enhanced.sh
   ```

2. **Migrate Commands**:
   - `/actions-fix` → `/gha:fix`
   - `/actions-create` → `/gha:create`
   - Add `/gha:setup-token` for enhanced performance

3. **Update Workflows**:
   - Run `/gha:fix --auto` to apply security updates
   - Verify all actions are SHA-pinned

4. **Set Up Token** (Recommended):
   ```bash
   claude
   > /gha:setup-token
   ```

### Breaking Changes Notice
