# /gha:jobs-fixfailed-ngu - Never Give Up GitHub Actions Fixer

## Workflow: Investigate → Fix → Test → Retry → VICTORY!

**Target:** Persistently fix failed GitHub Actions until ALL runs are green or exhaustion/loops detected

**Scope:** Relentless, determined fixing with retry loops and victory celebrations - Never Give Up attitude!

## 💪 Never Give Up Philosophy

**NGU = Never Give Up!** This command embodies absolute determination:
- 🔥 **Relentless**: Keeps trying different approaches until success
- 🧠 **Adaptive**: Learns from failed fixes and tries new strategies  
- 🎯 **Focused**: Won't stop until workflows are green
- 🛡️ **Safe**: Has loop detection and exhaustion limits to prevent infinite runs
- 🎉 **Celebratory**: Throws a victory party when everything works!

## 🎯 Interactive Mode Instructions
**IMPORTANT**: Maintain high energy and determination throughout:

1. **Battle cry start**: "💪 NGU MODE ACTIVATED! Never Give Up fixing GitHub Actions!"
2. **Progress updates**:
   - "🔥 Round 1: Identified 3 failures, applying fixes..."
   - "💪 Fixed npm issue, triggering new run... STILL FIGHTING!"
   - "🎯 Round 2: 1 failure remaining, trying different approach..."
   - "⚡ Applied dependency fix, waiting for validation..."
3. **Victory celebration**: "🎉 VICTORY! All workflows GREEN! NGU NEVER FAILS! 🏆"
4. **Exhaustion handling**: "😤 Reached retry limit, but NGU spirit lives on! Here's the battle report..."

**Tone**: Enthusiastic, determined, never defeated - like a coding warrior!

## Execution Steps

### 1. **Battle Assessment**
   - Get current failure state: `gh run list --limit 10 --status failure`
   - Analyze each failure with pattern recognition
   - Create battle plan with prioritized fix strategies
   - Set NGU parameters (max retries, loop detection, victory conditions)

### 2. **Fix Application Cycle**
   ```
   WHILE (failures exist AND retries < MAX_RETRIES AND not in loop):
   
     🔍 Analyze remaining failures
     🎯 Apply highest-confidence fixes
     ⏱️  Wait for workflow runs to complete
     📊 Check new status
     
     IF all green:
       🎉 VICTORY CELEBRATION!
       break
     
     IF same failures as previous round:
       📈 Increment loop counter
       🔄 Try alternative fix strategies
     
     📊 Update battle statistics    
   ```

### 3. **Adaptive Strategy Selection**
   - **Round 1**: High-confidence pattern-based fixes
   - **Round 2**: Alternative approaches for same errors
   - **Round 3**: Environmental and workflow configuration fixes
   - **Round 4**: Experimental and creative solutions
   - **Round 5+**: Increasingly desperate but safe attempts

### 4. **Victory Validation & Celebration**
   - Confirm all workflows are passing
   - Generate victory report with before/after stats
   - Celebrate with appropriate emoji party
   - Document successful strategies for future battles

### 5. **Exhaustion Handling**
   - Detect when stuck in loops or hit retry limits
   - Generate detailed battle report showing what was tried
   - Provide recommendations for manual intervention
   - Maintain NGU spirit even in "tactical retreat"

### **Tactical Retreat Report**
```markdown
# 😤 NGU TACTICAL RETREAT REPORT

## ⚠️ MISSION STATUS: STRATEGIC PAUSE REQUIRED

**Battle Duration**: 2 hours 15 minutes  
**Rounds Fought**: 5 (maximum reached)  
**Fixes Attempted**: 12  
**Current Status**: 2 workflows still failing  

## 💪 NGU SPIRIT ASSESSMENT
We fought hard, but these failures require human intervention:

### 🔍 **Remaining Challenges:**
1. **Deploy Workflow**: Complex environment configuration issue
   - **NGU Analysis**: Requires AWS credentials update (beyond automated scope)
   - **Confidence**: Would fix with manual intervention
   
2. **Integration Tests**: Database connection timeout  
   - **NGU Analysis**: Test environment infrastructure issue
   - **Confidence**: Needs ops team involvement

## 🎯 **NGU VICTORIES ACHIEVED:**
- ✅ Fixed CI workflow (npm dependency issues)
- ✅ Resolved Security scan (false positive handling)  
- ✅ Updated Build workflow (caching improvements)

## 💪 **NEVER GIVE UP SPIRIT LIVES ON!**
This is just a tactical retreat - NGU will return stronger! 
The battle may be paused, but the war for green workflows continues!

### 🛠️ **Recommended Human Actions:**
1. Update AWS credentials in repository secrets
2. Contact ops team about test database connectivity
3. Re-run `/gha:jobs-fixfailed-ngu` after manual fixes

**NGU AWAITS YOUR RETURN! 🚀**
```
