## ðŸ˜¤ Stubborn Issues That Remain
- **CI**: Still failing after 20 rounds

## ðŸ’¡ Recommended Future Strategies
1. Try different runner environments (ubuntu-20.04 vs ubuntu-latest)
2. Split complex workflows into smaller, focused jobs
3. Research community solutions for similar persistent issues
4. Consider alternative CI/CD approaches for problematic components
5. Investigate if issues are environment-specific vs code-specific

## ðŸ’ª "I'll be back for the next round!"
