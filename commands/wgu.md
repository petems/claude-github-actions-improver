# /gha:wgu - Won't Give Up GitHub Actions Fixer

## 🔥 Command Overview

**"This code is a fighter - he won't give up!"**

The `/gha:wgu` (Won't Give Up) command is the most persistent and determined GitHub Actions fixer. When you have workflows that just keep failing despite multiple attempts, this command becomes relentless - it will keep analyzing, fixing, and verifying until everything is green or it exhausts all possibilities.

## 🎯 Core Concept

Unlike other commands that analyze and fix once, `/gha:wgu` implements a **persistent retry loop**:

1. **🔍 Analyze** failing workflows with pattern recognition
2. **🔧 Apply fixes** based on root cause analysis  
3. **⏳ Wait and monitor** for new workflow runs to complete
4. **✅ Verify results** with `gh run list --limit 5`
5. **🔄 Repeat** until all workflows are green OR maximum attempts reached
6. **📝 Document** attempts and surrender only as last resort

## 🚀 Command Workflow

### Phase 1: Initial Assessment
```
(ง'̀-'́)ง
🔥 WGU: Won't Give Up GitHub Actions Fixer
💪 "This code is a fighter - analyzing the battlefield..."

📊 Initial Status Check:
• Found 5 failing workflows in last 24 hours
• 3 different error patterns detected
• 0% current success rate
• 🎯 Target: 100% success rate

💪 "Let's fight until everything is green!"
```

### Phase 2: The Fighting Loop
```
🥊 Round 1: Fighting the failures...
🔧 Applied 4 fixes:
   ✅ Updated Python dependencies in requirements.txt
   ✅ Fixed test discovery issues in pytest.ini
   ✅ Added missing environment variables
   ✅ Updated SHA-pinned actions

⏳ Waiting for workflows to run... (monitoring every 30 seconds)
📊 Current status: ci.yml ⏳ Running... | security.yml ⏳ Running...

🔍 Round 1 Results:
   ❌ ci.yml: Still failing (ImportError: No module named 'requests')
   ✅ security.yml: Now passing! 
   
💪 "Not giving up! One down, one to go..."

🥊 Round 2: Targeting remaining failures...
🔧 Applied 2 more fixes:
   ✅ Added 'requests>=2.28.0' to requirements.txt
   ✅ Updated pip install order in workflow

⏳ Waiting for new run... 
📊 Monitoring: ci.yml ⏳ Running...

🔍 Round 2 Results:
   ✅ ci.yml: SUCCESS! All tests passing!
   
🎉 VICTORY! All workflows now green!
୧༼ʘ̆ںʘ̆༽୨ VICTORIOUS FIGHTER! ୧༼ʘ̆ںʘ̆༽୨
💪 "Never gave up - that's the fighting spirit!"

📈 Final Results:
   • Rounds fought: 2
   • Total fixes applied: 6  
   • Success rate: 0% → 100%
   • Time to victory: 8 minutes
```

### Phase 3: Last Resort Documentation
```
💪 After 5 rounds of fighting...

😤 "I hate to admit it, but I'm stuck on this one..."

📝 Writing surrender document: WGU-BATTLE-REPORT.md

🥊 Battle Summary:
   • Rounds fought: 5
   • Total fixes attempted: 23
   • Remaining failures: 1 (mysterious Node.js memory issue)
   • Success rate: 80% → 95% (but not the 100% we wanted)

💡 Future battle strategies to try:
   • Investigate Node.js heap memory settings
   • Try different Node.js versions in matrix
   • Consider splitting large test suites
   • Research similar issues in community

💪 "I'll be back for round 6 when you're ready!"
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Loop Logic
```python
def wont_give_up_loop(max_rounds=10, wait_time=30):
    """The relentless retry loop that won't give up"""
    
    round_number = 1
    fixes_applied = []
    battle_history = []
    
    while round_number <= max_rounds:
        print(f"🥊 Round {round_number}: Fighting the failures...")
        
        # 1. Analyze current failures
        failures = analyze_failing_workflows()
        if not failures:
            victory_celebration()
            break
            
        # 2. Apply targeted fixes
        new_fixes = apply_intelligent_fixes(failures)
        fixes_applied.extend(new_fixes)
        
        # 3. Wait for workflows to complete
        wait_for_workflow_completion(wait_time)
        
        # 4. Check results
        results = check_workflow_status()
        battle_history.append({
            'round': round_number,
            'fixes': new_fixes,
            'results': results
        })
        
        # 5. Detect if we're looping on same issues
        if detect_loop_pattern(battle_history):
            print("💪 Detecting pattern loops - time for different tactics!")
            try_alternative_strategies()
        
        round_number += 1
    
    # Last resort: Write surrender document
    if round_number > max_rounds:
        write_battle_report(battle_history, fixes_applied)
```

### Waiting and Monitoring
```python
def wait_for_workflow_completion(base_wait=30):
    """Monitor workflows with patience and determination"""
    
    print("⏳ Waiting for workflows to run...")
    
    while True:
        status = get_recent_workflow_status()
        
        running_count = sum(1 for s in status if s == 'running')
        if running_count == 0:
            break
            
        print(f"📊 Still fighting: {running_count} workflows running...")
        time.sleep(base_wait)
        
    print("🔍 All workflows completed - checking results...")
```

### Loop Detection
```python
def detect_loop_pattern(battle_history, threshold=3):
    """Detect if we're stuck in a loop and need new tactics"""
    
    if len(battle_history) < threshold:
        return False
        
    recent_failures = [r['results']['failures'] for r in battle_history[-threshold:]]
    
    # If same failures keep appearing, we're looping
    if all(failures == recent_failures[0] for failures in recent_failures):
        return True
        
    return False
```

## 🏆 Motivational Messages

The command includes fighting spirit messages throughout:

```
💪 "This code is a fighter - he won't give up!"
🥊 "Round {N}: Back in the ring!"
🔥 "Failure is not an option - let's try again!"
💥 "One more fix, one step closer to victory!"
🎯 "Green is the only acceptable color here!"
⚡ "Persistence beats resistance!"
🚀 "Champions never quit, quitters never champion!"
```

## 📝 Battle Report Format

When surrender is necessary, WGU creates a detailed report:

```markdown
# WGU Battle Report - [Date]

## 🥊 Battle Summary
- **Duration**: X minutes
- **Rounds Fought**: N
- **Fixes Applied**: N
- **Initial Success Rate**: X%
- **Final Success Rate**: Y%

## 🔧 Fixes Attempted
1. [Round 1] Updated dependencies in requirements.txt
2. [Round 1] Fixed test configuration
3. [Round 2] Updated environment variables
... (all fixes chronologically)

## 😤 Stubborn Issues That Remain
- **Issue 1**: Node.js memory heap overflow
  - **Pattern**: Consistently fails on large test suites
  - **Attempts**: Tried 4 different approaches
  - **Next Strategy**: Research heap memory settings

## 💡 Recommended Future Strategies
1. Try Node.js v18 instead of v20
2. Split test suite into smaller chunks  
3. Increase GitHub Actions runner memory
4. Research community solutions for similar issues

## 💪 "I'll be back for the next round!"
```

## 🎯 Integration with Other Commands

WGU builds on existing command capabilities:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Uses `/gha:fix` analysis engine
- **Token Management**: Leverages `/gha:setup-token` for performance
- **Intelligence**: Incorporates `/gha:analyze` insights
- **Creation**: May use `/gha:create` for missing workflows

## 🚀 This is the command for when you need a fighter who NEVER GIVES UP! 💪
